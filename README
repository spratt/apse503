APSE503
========================================

A web method framework built with Java and MySQL using an agile methodology for the final design project for SAIT's Bachelor of Applied Information Systems Software Engineering degree.

The finished framework allows users to build and submit web methods, which could then be purchased and used by consumers on a per-use or per-method basis.
